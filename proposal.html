            <h2>Problem/Data Domain</h2>
            <p>
                For any student, mother, employee, teacher, everyone experiences stress or mentally weighing problems. These challenges can make it hard to motivate yourself to complete any tasks that you may have for school, work, or home. 
                Most people donâ€™t know what resources are available and where to find them so they inevitably end up bottling it all in. 
                The proccess of journaling and documenting memories is a key part of personal growth and mental well-being. In a traditional sense many people journal and document their lives through paper journals, 
                finstas, and private accounts that lack an intuitive and interactive way to pair images and thoughts. Additionally, there is a need for users to look back at their entries in a calendar-like format, providing a visual timeline of their posts.

            <h2>Proposed Application</h2>
            <p>
                "Keepsake" is a virtual journal application designed to combine the functionality of traditional journaling with the visual appeal of image-sharing platforms. Users can create 
                and personalize digital entries by posting text and images, allowing them to capture memories, thoughts, and moments in a creative and interactive way. Inspired by the Unread Project and BeReal's 
                calendar feature, Keepsake aims to provide users with a seamless way to track, reflect on, and organize their personal experiences over time.

                This application is designed for individuals who want to document and reflect on their daily lives in a more meaningful way. The application will take care to ensure accessibility and fufill the needs for different groups,
                 particularly by supporting features like mood tracking and emotional well-being.

            <h3>Evidence</h3>
            <p>
                According to an article from <a href="https://greatergood.berkeley.edu/article/item/how_journaling_can_help_you_in_hard_times" target="_blank"> UC Berkeley</a>, during a study conducted in 2006, it was actually found after the study that
                depression, anxiety, and hostility was greatly reduced from just journaling 15 minutes a day. 
                In another article on <a href="https://psychcentral.com/lib/the-health-benefits-of-journaling" target="_blank">PsychCentral</a> that was medically reviewed by a certified professional, it stated that in a study done by having the participants 
                perform online journaling for 12 weeks brought down mental distress by a significant amount and brought more resilience when participating in long-term journaling.
