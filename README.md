Keepsake is a online journal website that holds a user's precious daily memories. Users can signup/login, then upload their journal entry of the day and an optional picture to go along with it. Users can only do a journal entry of the current day. Users can also look back on past journal entries, organized by a timeline by date. Keepsake allows users to look back on and reflect on their day to day memories!
